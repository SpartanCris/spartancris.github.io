   <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio</h1> 
    
    <p> My name is Cristian Ramirez Reyes and this website will be my online portfolio that will talk about my skills, goals, life and several more things about myself. My goal with this website is to have something that people can go into when wanting to get to know better. A persona in a sense. I'm trying to hopefully get into the IT field so having a website would be must have. I will update this website as my skills and experiances grow throughout my life.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
